# Decentralized Autonomous Space Weather Network (DASWEN)

A global decentralized system for predicting and mitigating the effects of space weather on Earth's infrastructure and space-based assets.

## Overview

DASWEN creates a collaborative network of space weather observers, forecasters, and infrastructure operators using blockchain technology to ensure reliable data sharing, accurate predictions, and rapid response to space weather events.

### Key Features
